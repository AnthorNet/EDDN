Standard string values and IDs
----
Commodities, outfitting modules and ships are named inconsistently in various places within Elite: Dangerous and across third-party sites. And in some cases those names have changed over time. The files in this directory document for the commodity, outfitting and shipyard schemas:

- The preferred names/spellings for string values in messages sent over EDDN.
- The mapping between string values and "id"s.

Please note that there are some inconsistencies in these files - e.g "Cobra Mk III" and "Cobra MkIV". These inconsistencies are due to changes in Elite: Dangerous and are retained for compatibility.
